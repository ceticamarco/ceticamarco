Hi, I'm Marco. 👋

My interests span two main areas:

- **System Programming**: I have practical experience developing in C, (some)C++, Python, Go and Bash. Furthermore, I'm also familiar with Linux internals;  
- **Operations Research**: especially LP and MILP but also some constraint programming and combinatorial optimization.  

In this profile you will find some of the worth sharing projects I've built for fun over the years.
